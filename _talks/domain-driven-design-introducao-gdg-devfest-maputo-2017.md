## Abstract

[Software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world)
and [companies need to become software companies](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/273859).
It doesn't mater if the business is in traditional area, like finance or
manufacturing, software is no longer something to support the business, it is
become the business.

The "agile" revolution that has happened in the last years has dramatically
reduced the cycle to software delivery. However this revolution was partial only,
as many companies went through the "agile" didn't adopt the technical practices
which "agile" methodologies rely upon. What's worse, is that design has also been
relegated and therefore many projects are producing crappy code.

To companies this situation poses a great loss of opportunities, and the only way
around this is to get back into designing.

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a way of developing software which focuses on
implementing the best software design based on models that explicitly reflect
the core competencies of an organization. DDD forces the organization to
understand where it should distinguish it self from the competition, while at the
same time guiding in the creation of the "right" software. This all leads to
strategically valuable and useful software.

In this talk I'll provide an introduction to DDD, starting by clarifying the
reasoning for its need and then delving into what it is and how we can start
applying its techniques.
