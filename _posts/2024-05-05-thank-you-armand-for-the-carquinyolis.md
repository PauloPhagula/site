  Early this month I had the opportunity to travel to Spain for my company's
  yearly gathering, Facts by Factorial. I traveled with Osvaldo and arrived a
  couple of day's early, so we took the opportunity to visit Armand, a fellow
  and dear co-worker, and see the famous Tarrasa. Armand gifted us with a
  typical Catalan treat -- Carquinyolis -- which my family enjoyed so very
  much. But rather than just saying "thank you", I decided to complicate it.

In the stillness of the night, beneath the luminous gaze of the moon, our
family convened around the table, eager to indulge in a delicacy from the
verdant and mountainous realm known as Catalan.

Bearing the name Carquinyolis, these biscuits, adorned with chocolate, bestowed
upon our senses a dual sensation: a firmness that challenged our teeth yet
yielded to reveal an aroma and taste so divine.

With each morsel, our familial trio embarked upon a journey of gustatory
delight, our expressions betraying the involuntary utterances of pleasure that
accompanied each delectable bite.

Ah, the memory of Uncle Armandâ€™s thoughtful gift shall linger long in our
hearts, a testament to the generosity of the Catalan lands. Yet, as we revel in
the remnants of our feast, we cannot help but ponder when next we shall be
graced with such culinary marvels, eagerly anticipating the return of the
Carquinyolis to our humble abode.
