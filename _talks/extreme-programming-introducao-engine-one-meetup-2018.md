## Abstract

This talk is precisely what the name says it is, an introduction to
Extreme Programming (XP). Among other things, it outlines: what XP is; where it
came from; why is it important; what are the values, principles and practices of
it; what are the challenges found when trying to use apply it to a team and ideas
on how to overcome those challenges. Additionally it tries to clarify on the
common doubts people have regarding the relationship between XP, agile, lean and
scrum. It is entry level talk and not much is asked from the audience.
