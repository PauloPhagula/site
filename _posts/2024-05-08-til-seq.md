  A quick tip on the `seq` CLI utility
---

Seq is a simple GNU/Linux utility command that can be used to output a sequence of
values. Typically it's used in combination with other commands like `xargs` for
further processing. As an example, at Factorial -- which is were I first saw this
command in used --  we have an example for testing rack-attack rules that reads: `seq NUM | xargs -iZ curl ...`

In this case if we change NUM by 10, then we'd run 10 curl requests on our endpoint.

The tool is not has more options, that allow us to skip some values and change output formatting.
