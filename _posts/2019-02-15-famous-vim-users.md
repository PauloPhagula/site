title: Famous Vim users (that are not famous for using Vim)
excerpt: >
  Having read “Famous Emacs users (that are not famous for using Emacs)”,
  I thought I’d do the same for Vim, just to keep the war going :trollface:

I don’t think using Vim could make you a better programmer, nor do I think that
having a couple of relatively famous middle or old aged people using (or
previously using) Vim could prove that Vim has some unique power.

However, when I started using it, there were a few Vim users that I have high
respect for, which is one of the reasons that made me continue to play with it.
Here I have created a list of famous Vim users and hope it will (mis)guide
newbies.

This list will be updated occasionally (the latest updates will be on the top)
and revision is highly welcomed.

NOTE: Where possible I made the videos start exactly where Vim is used so you
don’t have to look it up for yourself.
