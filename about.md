### Development / Programming

Everything is about apps and sites these days. My skill set consists of both
native android and hybrid web-based solutions. I can provide you with anything
from a simple website to an entire custom-built solution tailored for your needs.

If you're hung up on a particular project or just need an extra eye to help with
debugging, contact me and we'll get it done.

### Domain Registration, Website and Email Hosting

Setting up your domains and hosting can be a daunting task, with so much techy
terminology involved. I aim to alleviate the pain by offering basic hosting
for those simpler sites and support for the more complex ones.
