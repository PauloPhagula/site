Ahoy, my name is Paulo Phagula
footnote:[
Well actually, I'm *Pagula* but the folks at the registry messed things up.
You may also find other variants of the name written as *Pacula* or *Pacule*.
Also the *h* in *Pha* is silent, so you don't spell it like an "eff" as in "Pharmacy",
you spell it in the same way you start saying *Party*
]
and I'm a software engineer mainly interested
in web development, programming tools and technologies.

education and financial inclusion challenges in emerging economies.

Along my career, I've worked in many domains, like Banking & Finances, Human Resources
