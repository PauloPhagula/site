Hi all,

What's the difference between a Mock and a Stub?
Can anyone make this clearer?

Thanks in Advance

In order to ease understanding by all, I'll start by providing a bit more of context
as to what he's talking about -- test doubles -- , why we need them, and when we
should use them. Then, address the question more directly by providing <<taxonomy>>.

[NOTE]
====
Even though the example code is written using a particular language,
testing framework, and mocking library
(PHP, https://phpunit.de[PHPUnit], and https://github.com/phpspec/prophecy[Prophecy]
footnote:[
If you wonder why I didn't use PHPUnit's built-in mocking facilities, it's because
they're pretty much only there to keep backwards compatibility. Sebastian Bergmann
-- the creator of PHPUnit -- himself has said he does not recommend using them,
and suggests we use Prophecy, so much so he added "native" support for it onto
PHPUnit.

),
the content and ideas are generic and can be used in any other platform with any
other libraries of choice. I'd be remiss though, if I didn't tell you that,
depending on your platform of choice, you may not find direct equivalents of the
constructs used here. Regardless, getting bigger picture is what's important,
since then you can port the ideas to whatever constructs are more idiomatic to
your platform.

== What are Test Doubles

Test Double is a generic term for any case where you replace a production object
or procedure with another for testing purposes. In automated unit testing, a test
double replaces an object on which the System Under Test (SUT) depends on.

Test doubles are popularly (and incorrectly) called Mock objects, but in reality,
a mock object is a very specific type of test double.

____
The word "mock" is sometimes used in an informal way to refer to the
whole family of objects that are used in tests. They are called test doubles.

...They were introduced at XP2000 in a paper called
http://connextra.com/aboutUs/mockobjects.pdf[Endo-Testing: Unit Testing with Mock Objects],
and it took a long time after that for them to gain popularity.
Their role in software development was still being fleshed out in 2004 when
http://jmock.org/oopsla2004.pdf[Mock Roles, Not Objects] was published.

**The key reason for tests doubles is to help us design how our objects
communicate**. They help in verifying indirect output of the SUT, by checking
that it interacted with it's (direct or indirect) collaborators in an expected
way. We do that by replacing the objects the SUT depends on with doubles that
record how they are called, such that, we can check if the SUT interacted
with it's dependencies as expected or not, if it did it at all. This is illustrated
in the figure below.

.Test code stimulating the SUT and checking expectations on test doubles through a Mockery
image::/content/2018/10/testing-mock-objects.png[Test code stimulating SUT and checking expectations on test doubles]

Mock objects help us move from state-based testing to interaction-based testing,
where rather than looking at the objects' state, we look at their interactions and
behaviour. This stops us from having to add unneeded getters to our code just to
be able to assert they have the right state.

Another reason we use test doubles is for code isolation
(Read the "<<warning>>" section below before jumping to conclusions).
When we're testing code that depends on another class, we provide the object with a double
instance of that class, instead of a real object. That way, we're making sure
that our test will only fail if the SUT is broken, and not if one of it's
dependencies is broken.

Doubles also allow us to replace/override/patch some functions on objects so
that we can ease testing. An example of that is when you have written an
encoding algorithm which you want to test. This algorithm uses a function
`getRandomPrime()` from another class (in this example `RandomGenerator`).
For testing the encoding algorithm you need to know the value of the
parameters and the resulting return value for your assertions. To solve the
problem, that the return value depends on a random value you can "stub" the
class `RandomGenerator` and tell the function `getRandomPrime()` to return 7
every time it's called during the test.

NOTE: We can also create double objects from interfaces. This makes a lot of sense
if we think about it. In many cases, we should actually use _doubled_
interfaces in tests instead of doubled concrete classes. After all, the
interface is the contract by which classes agree to talk to the outside
world.

Summarizing, the typical reasons for using test doubles may include:

* "These getters we write for testing are cluttering up the design",
i.e. adding otherwise unnecessary getters to many objects in order to get
object state so that we can verify expectations, ultimately cluttering up the
design
* Difficulties with integration testing - some parts are slow or expensive to test
* Non-deterministic behaviour (date & time, web service APIs, pseudo-random functions, etc.)
* Dependency on an external resource: FS, DB, net, printer
* improve the performance of our tests
* real object hasn't been written yet
* what you're calling has UI/needs human interaction
* simplify test setup
* build in smaller increments

____
Sometimes it is just plain hard to test the system under test (SUT) because
it depends on other components that cannot be used in the test environment.
This could be because they aren't available, they will not return the results
needed for the test or because executing them would have undesirable side
effects. In other cases, our test strategy requires us to have more control
or visibility of the internal behaviour of the SUT. When we are writing a
test in which we cannot (or chose not to) use a real depended-on component
(DOC), we can replace it with a Test Double. The Test Double doesn't have to
behave exactly like the real DOC; it merely has to provide the same API as
the real one so that the SUT thinks it is the real one!

____

== Allowances and Expectations

When working with Test Doubles it's important to make a distinction
between allowances and expectations.

Expectations describe the interactions that are essential to the protocol we're
testing: "if we send this message to the object, we expect to see it send this
other message to this neighbor".

Allowances support the interaction we're testing. We often use them as
stubs to feed values into the object, to get the object into the right
state for the behavior we want to test. We also use them to ignore other
interactions that aren't relevant to the current test.

All expectations must be met during a test, but allowances may be matched or not.

Depending on the tools we're using it may be very explicit which is which, --
for instance, In JMock and Mockery the language is very explicit, but Jasmine and
Prophet not so much -- but what's more important is the concept and having in
mind what each other is.

TIP: Allow Queries; Expect Commands

[[taxonomy]]
== A taxonomy of test doubles

Terms like *fakes*, *mocks*, and *stubs* are often used interchangeably,
however they are not the same. Each replaces a real object in the test
environment but the behavior can be quite different:

=== Dummy

Replaces an object typically as an input to fill parameter lists, that
isn't used in the test but is needed for the test setup (arranging).

It's methods just return null or comply with their signature, i.e. if it
must return a string, it will return an empty string.

You pass it into something when you don't care how it's used.

The example we're going to use if of a simple login system, that requires an
authorizer object to check for acceptable username/password combinations. Our
SUT is the `System`.

We'll be using Prophecy, and simply put, the way it works, is by having a prophet
specify/"predict" the future behavior of objects of interest (prophecies) and then later
check that the predictions were met or not. PHPUnit has built-in support for Prophecy
and we can used it in our tests by accessing the variable `$this->prophet`.

[source,php]
----
<?php

class System {
    // ...
    public function __construct(Authorizer $authorizer) {
        $this->authorizer = $authorizer;
    }

    public function logIn($username, $password) {
        if ($this->authorizer->authorize($username, $password)) {
            $this->loginCount++;
        }
    }

    public function getLoginCount() {
        return $this->loginCount;
    }
    // ...
}

class SystemTest {
  // ...
  public function test_newly_created_system_has_no_logged_in_users() {
      $authProphecy = $this->prophet->prophesize(Authorizer::class); // <1>
      $system = new System($authProphecy->reveal()); // <2>

      $this->assertEqual(0, $system->getLoginCount()); // <3>
  }
  // ...
}
----
<1> Using the `prophet` object we create a new prophecy for an `Authorizer::class`.
Using the created prophecy object we can specify how the  `Authorizer` object
will behave and what might our expectations be about it regarding how our SUT
interacts with it, i.e. we can say what it should do when poked in a certain way,
record what is done to it, and be able to check how the SUT interacted with it,
if it did at all.
<2> by revealing a prophecy we obtain an actual test double object, which we can
then use with our SUT. In this example we didn't specify any allowances nor
expectations on the prophecy, and thus when revealing it all we'll get is a dummy
for the `Authorizer` class. We know the SUT won't/shouldn't interact with dummy
during this test and that's why we stay at that. We just need the dummy because
the `System` demands and `Authorizer`, even though it won't use it.
<3> Finally we invoke our SUT and assert it behaved correctly.

=== Stub

Provides a preset (canned) answer to method calls that we have decided ahead
of time, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed
in for the test.

With stubs, you don't care how many times (if at all) the stub is called.
Stubs are used to provide "indirect input" to the system under test.

[source,php]
----
<?php
public function test_counts_successfully_authorized_logIns() {
    $authProphecy = $this->prophet->prophesize(Authorizer::class);
    $system = new System($authProphecy->reveal());

    $authProphecy->authorize('dareenzo', '123')->willReturn(true); // <1>

    $system->logIn('dareenzo', '123'); // <2>

    $this->assertSame(1, $system->getLoginCount()); // <3>
}
----
<1> In this case we define an allowance. Our SUT or any other involved object in
our test can interact with the stubbed `Authorizer` object, and call `authorize()`,
which in turn will return true (regardless of the params in this particular case).
<2> We invoke the SUT which in turn will interact with the stubbed class, and finally
raise the number of login counts.
<3> Lastly we check our expectations on the SUT.

Put simply a stub is a "When I say 'marco', you say 'polo'"

IMPORTANT: We could've constrained the stub to only work for some params and not
for others, in order to make our test more valid.

=== Spy 🕵️

Acts as a higher level stub, that allows us to also record information about
what happened with this test double and how it was called (by the tested
code). One form of this might be an email service that records how many
messages it has sent or a login service that records what parameters were use
to call a method on it.

It records what functions were called, with what arguments, when, and how often.

Spies are used for verifying "indirect output" of the tested code, by
verifying expectations on how the tested code interacted with the test double
afterwards the tested code is executed.

[source,php]
----
<?php
public function test_counts_successfully_authorized_logins() {
    $authProphecy = $this->prophet->prophesize(Authorizer::class);
    $system = new System($authProphecy->reveal());

    $authProphecy->authorize('dareenzo', '123')->willReturn(true);  // <1>

    $system->logIn('dareenzo', '123');

    $authProphecy->authorize('dareenzo', '123')->shouldHaveBeenCalled(); // <2>
}
----
<1> Just like before we stub a method on the authorizer which we know the SUT is
going to call.
<2> Notice here that we no longer use some form of assertion, instead we use the
prophecy to check wether the SUT did the right thing and called our spy with the
expected params `('dareenzo', '123')`. Our verification could be even more thorough,
say something like checking that it was called only once.

=== Mock

Acts as a higher level stub, that is pre-programmed with expectations,
including the ability to both respond to calls they know about and don't know
about, i.e. they're are pre-programmed with expectations which form a
specification of the calls they expect to receive.

They can throw an exception if they receive a call they don't expect and are
checked during verification to ensure they got all the calls they were
expecting.

Mocks are used for verifying "indirect output" of the tested code, by
defining expectations on how the tested code should interact with the double,
before the tested code is executed.

[source,php]
----
<?php
public function test_counts_successfully_authorized_logins() {
    $authProphecy = $this->prophet->prophesize(Authorizer::class);
    $system = new System($authProphecy->reveal());

    $authProphecy->authorize('dareenzo', '123')->willReturn(true); // <1>
    $authProphecy->authorize()->shouldBeCalled(); // <2>

    $system->logIn('dareenzo', '123'); // <3>

    $this->prophet->checkPredictions(); // <4>
}
----
<1> We start by stubbing some behaviour we know is going to be required by the SUT
<2> Then we specify our expectation
<3> Invoke the SUT and hope it will satisfy our expectation
<4> Finally, we check with our prophet if our predictions were met or not.

=== Fake

Replaces an object for which we need a simplified version of the
original/real object, typically to achieve speed improvements or to eliminate
side effects.

Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some
shortcut which makes them unsuitable for production (an `InMemoryRepository` is
a good example).

Unlike other test doubles, no mocking framework is used to create fakes.

I'll refrain from showing a coding example, as I think the idea is very clear for
this one. If you're testing something that interacts with nukes, don't launch
the bloody nukes, use a paper fake for now.

'''''

Put in a simpler way:

* Dummy -> I do nothing at all but to fill parameter list
* Stub -> canned Answers
* Spy -> stubs + interaction recording (for late interaction expectations verification)
* Mock -> stubs + expectations on interaction
* Fake -> I seem real but no

Just to further clarify Spies and Mocks are similar, the difference between
them is that, with Spies we use them and then check expectations afterwards;
while with Mocks we define the expectations beforehand and only then we use
them


[[warning]]
== A warning about over-isolating, specially through Mocking

Due to wrong influences, many people fall for relentless isolation and end-up
finding solace in test doubles as their magic tool for helping in isolating
parts, yet they're just painting themselves into a corner with a painful cost
to get out from.

Mocking is about object communication and interface discovery, using it for isolation,
specially from 3rd party code is a misuse, in fact a general rule of thumb when
mocking is "do not mock what you don't own". Wrappers and Anti-Corruption Layers
are more appropriate tools for avoiding contamination by 3rd code than mock objects.

Additionally, over-mocking can usually have the effect of duplicating implementation
code in the tests as we try to mock the behaviour of objects. This code quickly
gets outdated as we change the production code, and give us the work of trying to
keep production and test code in sync. We should refrain from this and try as much
as possible to use real collaborators when possible, as Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen
put it:

____
When your tests use the same collaborators as your application, they always
break when they should. The value of this cannot be underestimated

-- Sandi Metz & Katrina Owen

== Resources

The bestest -- pun intended -- resource on Mocking is the
http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com[Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests (GOOS)]
book by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.
They're the pioneers of the technique and better than anyone took the time to
distill their experience with using Mock Objects in the book.

With that said, I can't recommend more the following two talks, they're made by
the very pillars of testing in PHP community.
