## Abstract

The need to have a logic way or organizing and controlling revisions of documents
exists almost since man started writing. Book editions are an example of that in
the "print" age. Today, we live in a digital age, and Version Control Systems (VCS)
exists to help us just with that. Simpler forms of these systems can be found
embedded in text editors and spreadsheet calculators as simple buttons such undo
and redo.

In software development, source-code is usually maintained as a set of several
plain-text files which developers keep editing to add and remove functionalities,
or correct bugs.
Developers need to collaborate on these files. They need to be able to change
them in different ways and in parallel, while also being able to merge their
individual changes into the original document without "stepping into each others
toes". Revision control systems are what allows them be able to do that, and Git
is one of the most popular and widely used of those systems.

This talk helps developers get a feel of what Git is and how to use it to address
these needs.
