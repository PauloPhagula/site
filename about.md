What can I help you with?

### Development / Programming

Everything is about apps and sites these days. My skill set consists of both native android and hybrid web-based solutions. I can provide you with anything from a simple WordPress or Umbraco website to an entire custom-built web solution tailored for your needs.
If you're hung up on a particular project or just need an extra eye to help with debugging, contact me and we'll get it done.

### Domains Registration, Website and Email Hosting

I know setting up your domains and hosting can be a daunting task, with so much techy terminology involved. I aim to alleviate the pain by offering basic hosting for those simpler sites and support for the more complex ones.
