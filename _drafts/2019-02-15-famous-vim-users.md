title: Famous Vim users (that are not famous for using Vim)
excerpt: >
  Having read “Famous Emacs users (that are not famous for using Emacs)”,
  I thought I’d do the same for Vim, just to keep the war going.

I don’t think using Vim could make you a better programmer, nor do I think that
having a couple of relatively famous middle or old aged people using (or
previously using) Vim could prove that Vim has some unique power.

However, when I started, there were a few Vim users that I have high respect
for, which is one of the reasons that made me continue to play with Vim. Here I
have created a list of famous Vim users and hope it will (mis)guide newbies.

This list will be updated occasionally (the latest updates will be on the top)
and revision is highly welcomed.

## Rasmus Lerdorf - the creator of PHP

Rasmus Lerdorf programmed in Vim during his talks, e.g.

## Larry Wall - the creator of Perl
