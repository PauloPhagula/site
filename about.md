I'm a driven, passionate and experienced software craftsman, working alongside stakeholders, business owners and designers, to develop modern, valuable and meaningful products for businesses, institutions and individuals.

I blog about technology, culture, gadgets, diversity, code, the web, where we're going and we've been and I'm excited about community, social equity, media, entrepeneurship and above all, the open web.

What can I help you with?

### Development / Programming

Everything is about apps and sites these days. My skill set consists of both native android and hybrid web-based solutions. I can provide you with anything from a simple WordPress or Umbraco website to an entire custom-built web solution tailored for your needs.
If you're hung up on a particular project or just need an extra eye to help with debugging, contact me and we'll get it done.

### Domains Registration, Website and Email Hosting

I know setting up your domains and hosting can be a daunting task, with so much techy terminology involved. I aim to alleviate the pain by offering basic hosting for those simpler sites and support for the more complex ones.
