excerpt: >
  This is a complete list of the tools, apps, services and hardware I use on a
  regular basis. The list contains tools I use in my work as a web developer but
  also tools I use at home.

  If you're interested in similar lists, I highly recommend that you visit the

Since I'll never be interviewed for [Uses This](https://usesthis.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"},
I have interviewed myself!

## Who are you, and what do you do?

See [/about](/about)

## What hardware do you use?

## And what software?

Software is important to me. It helps me solve my problems on a daily basis. If
a service is great I don't hesitate to pay a monthly subscription or a one-time
fee.

## What would be your dream setup?

For someone who claims not to be Google fanboy I surely do use many of their services
